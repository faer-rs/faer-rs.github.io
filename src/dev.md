A (currently incomplete) guide for developers is available in the faer repository in the [book subdirectory](https://github.com/sarah-ek/faer-rs/tree/main/book).

This guide aims to explain in detail the various techniques used to implement each algorithm, as well as ensuring good performance and numerical stability.

The guide is written in [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst), and can be compiled using the command line tool.
